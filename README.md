The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for patient mortality using various machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to determine the most effective classification approach.

**Data Preprocessing**: handling missing values, feature engineering and correlation analysis.\
**Model Implementation**: after preprocessing the dataset, several classification models were implemented and compared: Logistic Regression, SGD Classifier, SVM Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
**Results & Evaluation**: models were evaluated based on key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC scores on a test set. The best-performing model was selected for further optimization.
